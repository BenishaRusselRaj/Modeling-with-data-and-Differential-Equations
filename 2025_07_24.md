### Modeling biological dynamics of disease spread - 1

Model-1 states that the rate of change of infected people is directly proportional to the number of infected people. to remove proportionality, we introduce a constant k, which signifies the infection rate.

dI/dt = kI

Why is Model-1 rejected?

Model-2 includes the number of susceptible people also.
   k
S --> I

dS/dt = -kS
dI/dt = kS

The total system consists of both S and I.
Total population, N = S + I

=> dI/dt = k(N-I)

Why is Model-2 rejected?
